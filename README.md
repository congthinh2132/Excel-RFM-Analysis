# Excel RFM Analysis
## I. Introduction:
### 1. About RFM Analysis:
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a proven marketing model for behavior-based customer segmentation. It groups customers based on their transaction history:
- **Recency:** Measures How recently a customer has made a purchase
- **Frequency:** How often a customer makes a purchase
- **Monetary value:** How much money a customer spends on purchases

RFM analysis numerically ranks a customer in each of these three categories, generally on a scale of 1 to 5 (the higher the number, the better the result). The “best” customer would receive a top score in every category.

These three RFM factors can be used to reasonably predict how likely (or unlikely) it is that a customer will do business again with a firm or, in the case of a charitable organization, make another donation.
### 2. Dataset:
The dataset represents transactional data from a Superstore Giant, providing key insights into customer segments, purchase behavior, and regional performance. It includes details critical for analyzing and understanding market trends. Key attributes include:
- Customer Information: Unique customer IDs, customer names, and segment classifications (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).
- Product Details: Categories, subcategories, product IDs, and product names.
- Transaction Data: Order dates, shipping dates, sales amounts, quantities, discounts, and profit margins.
- Regional Insights: Geographic regions, states, cities, and postal codes linked to transactions.
- Shipping Information: Shipping modes and associated delivery times.

This dataset aims to support analysis of customer segments by identifying product preferences, evaluating regional performance, and uncovering category trends, enabling the Superstore Giant to design targeted marketing strategies and enhance overall business performance.
