# Excel RFM Analysis
## I. Introduction:
### 1. About RFM Analysis:
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a proven marketing model for behavior-based customer segmentation. It groups customers based on their transaction history:
- **Recency:** Measures How recently a customer has made a purchase
- **Frequency:** How often a customer makes a purchase
- **Monetary value:** How much money a customer spends on purchases

RFM analysis numerically ranks a customer in each of these three categories, generally on a scale of 1 to 5 (the higher the number, the better the result). The “best” customer would receive a top score in every category.

These three RFM factors can be used to reasonably predict how likely (or unlikely) it is that a customer will do business again with a firm or, in the case of a charitable organization, make another donation.
### 2. Business Questions:
- The Marketing Department aims to classify customer segments to tailor marketing programs for each group effectively.
- The Marketing Director has proposed utilizing the RFM model in Excel to segment customers. 
- This approach will support launching marketing campaigns to express gratitude to loyal customers and nurture potential customers into becoming long-term supporters of the company.
